## Documentation

#### Create a new player instance.
```dart
Player player = new Player(id: 69420);
```

#### Create a media for playback.
```dart
Media media0 = await Media.file(
  new File('C:/music.mp3')
);

Media media1 = await Media.network(
  'https://www.example.com/music.aac'
);

Media media2 = await Media.asset(
  'assets/music.ogg'
);
```

#### Create a list of medias using playlist.
```dart
Playlist playlist = new Playlist(
  medias: [
    await Media.file(new File('C:/music.mp3')),
    await Media.asset('assets/music.ogg'),
    await Media.network('https://www.example.com/music.aac'),
  ],
);
```

#### Open a media or playlist into a player.
```dart
player.open(
  new Playlist(
    medias: [
      await Media.file(new File('C:/music0.mp3')),
      await Media.file(new File('C:/music1.mp3')),
      await Media.file(new File('C:/music2.mp3')),
    ],
  ),
  autoStart: true, // default
);
```

#### Control playback.
```dart
player.play();

player.seek(Duration(seconds: 30));

player.pause();

player.playOrPause();

player.stop();
```

#### Manipulate an already playing playlist.
```dart
player.add(
  await Media.file(new File('C:/music0.mp3')),
);

player.remove(4);

player.insert(
  2,
  await Media.file(new File('C:/music0.mp3')),
);

player.move(0, 4);
```

#### Set playback volume & rate.
```dart
player.setVolume(0.5);

player.setRate(1.25);
```

#### Get & change playback device.
```dart
List<Device> devices = await Devices.all;

player.setDevice(
  devices[0],
);
```

#### Show the video inside widget tree.

Instanciate `Player` as follows.
```dart
Player player = new Player(
  id: 69420,
  videoWidth: 480,
  videoHeight: 320,
);
```
Show `Video` in the `Widget` tree.
```dart
class _MyAppState extends State<MyApp> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: Video(
        playerId: 69420,
        height: 1920.0,
        width: 1080.0,
        scale: 1.0, // default
        showControls: false, // default
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Thanks to [@tomassasovsky](https://github.com/tomassasovsky) for adding visual controls to `Video` widget.

#### Retrieve metadata of media.
```dart
Media media = await Media.network(
  'https://www.example.com/media.mp3',
  parse: true,
  timeout: new Duration(seconds: 10),
);

Map<String, String> metas = media.metas;
```

#### Listen to playback events.

(Same can be retrieved directly from `Player` instance without having to rely on stream).

```dart
player.currentStream.listen((CurrentState state) {
  state.index;
  state.media;
  state.medias;
  state.isPlaylist;
});
```

```dart
player.positionStream.listen((PositionState state) {
  state.position;
  state.duration;
});
```

```dart
player.playbackStream.listen((PlaybackState state) {
  state.isPlaying;
  state.isSeekable;
  state.isCompleted;
});
```

```dart
player.generalStream.listen((GeneralState state) {
  state.volume;
  state.rate;
});
```

#### Broadcast a media.

Broadcasting to localhost.

```dart
Broadcast broadcast = await Broadcast.create(
  id: 0,
  media: await Media.file(new File('C:/video.mp4')),
  configuration: new BroadcastConfiguration(
    access: 'http',
    mux: 'mpeg1',
    dst: '127.0.0.1:8080',
    vcodec: 'mp1v',
    vb: 1024,
    acodec: 'mpga',
    ab: 128,
  ),
);
broadcast.start();
```

Dispose the `Broadcast` instance to release resources.
```dart
broadcast.dispose();
```

#### Record a media.

Thanks to [@DomingoMG](https://github.com/DomingoMG) for adding `Record` and `Chromecast` classes.

```dart
Record record = await Record.create(
  id: 205, 
  media: await Media.network('https://www.example.com/streaming-media.MP3'), 
  pathFile: '/home/alexmercerind/recording.MP3',
);
record.start();
```

**NOTE:** For using this plugin on Linux, you must have [VLC](https://www.videolan.org) & [libVLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/libvlc.html) installed. On debian based distros, run:

```bash
sudo apt-get install vlc
```
```bash
sudo apt-get install libvlc-dev
```

## Example

You can see an example project [here](https://github.com/alexmercerind/dart_vlc/blob/master/example/lib/main.dart).

Windows

## Workings

The internal wrapper used in the plugin is [here](https://github.com/alexmercerind/dart_vlc/tree/master/dartvlc) in the repository (Based on libVLC++). It makes handling of events and controls a lot easier & has additional features to it.

Same wrapper will be used for upcoming FFI version.

I preferred to do majority of plugin handling in C++ itself, thus Dart code is minimal & very slight mapping to it.

Massive thanks to [@stuartmorgan](https://github.com/stuartmorgan) from [Flutter](http://flutter.dev) team to review code & help me fix the loopholes. 


## Contributions

The code in the project is nicely arranged (I guess), I have added comments wherever I felt necessary.

Contributions to the project are open, it will be appreciated if you discuss the bug-fix/feature-addition in the issues first.

## Vision

There aren't any media (audio or video) playback libraries for Flutter on Windows/Linux yet. So, this project is all about that.
As one might be already aware, VLC is one of the best media playback tools out there.

So, now you can use it to play audio or video files from Flutter Desktop apps.

Although, the mentioned repositories above are for audio playback, video playback is also a part of consideration for this project.
