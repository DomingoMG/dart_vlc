# dart_vlc_ffi

#### Bringing power of VLC to Flutter & Dart apps on all platforms.

[WIP] FFI based binding to [dart_vlc wrapper](https://github.com/alexmercerind/dart_vlc/tree/master/dartvlc) (Based on [libVLC](https://github.com/videolan/vlc) & [libVLC++](https://github.com/videolan/libvlcpp)).

Planned to be used in Dart console apps & flutter apps other than Windows & Linux.

Uses NativePorts to notify about playback events to Dart from C++.
